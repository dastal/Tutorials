# Arrays #

Arrays are containers to store large lists of values, whereas the number of elements that it contians is not relevant. 
It also does not matter what kind of information is stored in this array, all types of variables can be combined inside an array.

The array is built as follows:

```
$listOfElements = array(element1, element2, element3, element4);
```

The indexing in the PHP array starts at 0.

# Data Types #

The following data types are the main data types. 99% of the time these values are used for programming PHP.

Generally: Always start the variable with `$`. 

## String ##
A string in PHP is always set in quotation marks and could for example look as follows:

```html
$phrase = "To be or not to be.";
```

## Integer ##
An integer is a full number without a decimal point. It could look as follows:

```html
$age = 31;
```

## Floating Point Nubmber ##
This is the decimal number in PHP. It has a decimal point in it and could look as follows:

```html
$gpa = 30.0;
```

## Boolean ##
This data type can be either "true" (1) or "false" (0). It could look as follows:

```html
$isMale = true;
```

## Null Value ##
The null value indicates that there is no value. It looks as follows:

```html
null
```

# Writing HTML #

The following code snippet (within the php tag) prints out "Hello World" to the screen/browser.

```html
echo("Hello World");
```

The same code snippet is also correct without the open and close parentheses.

```html
echo "Hello World";
```

It is also possible to write HTML code into this echo command:

```html
echo "<h1>Dave's Site<h1>";
```

This prints out an h1 Title containing whatever is written between the HTML tags.

So from within this php tag it is possible to render a whole website.

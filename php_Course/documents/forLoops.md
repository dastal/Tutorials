# For Loops #

The template for a for loop is as follows:

```
for($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++){
	do something;
}
```

In the for loop parentheses, there is forst the initialization of the iterative variable, then the for loop condition, follwed by the increment/ decrement. The variables are of course just examples.

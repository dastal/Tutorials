# Associative Arrays #

In assiciative arrays we can key-value pairs for different access of the elements of the array. This means that every value in this array is inserted with a key belonging.
When we want to access this value now, we just need to search trought the array with the key.

The template for that is as follows:

```
$list = array("key1"=>"value1", "key2"=>"value2", "key3"=>"value3");
```

Pay attention that the keys are unique!

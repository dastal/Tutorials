# POST vs. GET #

Basically, those are two different ways to get information from users.

## GET ##
The information is put in the URL as a URL parameter. This happens also with the password, which is showing up in the URL, and this is not good, the user should never be able to change it in the middle of the process.

## POST ##
POST does exactly the same thing as GET does, except that it does not put the information into the URL as a URL parameter, this means that it is going to be more secure.

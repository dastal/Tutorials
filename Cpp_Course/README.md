# Cpp_Course
Introductory C++ Course (Tutorial)


Tutorial I completed to get used to C++ programming language and to continue my overview over the most important programming languages. Used tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=117s

## Setup
- IDE: http://codeblocks.org/downloads/26#windows - Select "codeblocks-xx.xxmingw-setup.exe" Download from: Sourceforge.net

## Creating New Project
- Open CodeBlocks
- Hit "Create new a project"
- Bare Basic Project: Hit "Console application" -> "Next" -> Choose "C++" and hit "Next" -> Enter Project Name (here: Cpp_Tutorial) and choose the project folder, hit "Next" -> Hit "Finish"
- At the left-hand-side there should appear the project workspace with the folder: "{Project_Name}" containing the folder "Sources" which contains the file "main.cpp"
- Right-click on "main.cpp" and open it
- It should look the following way:

```#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
- To continue, click the icon "Build and Run" in the Toolbar (a green triangle and a gray gear). This should open a window which says "Hello World"

# Topics

For further explanation have a look at the commits.

9. Building a mad Libs Game: mad_libs.c
10. Arrays: arrays.c
11. Functions: functions.c
12. Return Statement: return_statement.c
13. If Statements: if_statements_I.c & if_statements_II.c

27. Inheritance: inheritance.c

## Conclusion
- IDE: The orthography function is really nice
- IDE: Errors don't have a message, so when an error occur it could take a while under circumstances.
- Switch statements are really powerful and save alot of time.
- The print statements are a lot more powerful than in C.
- The difference between char and string is very annoying.

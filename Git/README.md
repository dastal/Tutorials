# Git Course #
Course that I completed since I got the feeling that I knew to less about Git and Github. I used 
the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk) for the course.

## Setup ##
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

| Topic | Description |

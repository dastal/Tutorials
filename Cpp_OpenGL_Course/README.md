# C++ OpenGL Course
 C++ OpenGL Tutorial I completed to get used to OpenGL. Therefore I used this [Tuturial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRYHly3bl2Q&list=PLStQc0GqppuWBDuNWnkQ8rzmyx35AINyt).
 
 ## General Infromation about OpenGL
 - OpenGL is just a specification. If something in the code does not work, first update the graphics driver.
 - Find the OpenGL Documentation [here](http://docs.gl/)
 
 ## Equipment
 - IDE: [Windows Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/)
 - [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/): Development Library, Visual C++ Version
 - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/): Windows 32-bit and 64-bit,

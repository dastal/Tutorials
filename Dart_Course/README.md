# Dart Course #
Course I completed to get introduced into Dart programming. I used this [titorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_Pcr4uC2Q) for the course.

## Setup ##
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code; Install the Dart extension to VS Code
- [Dart Pad](https://dartpad.dev/): Online Environment to run Dart code
- Dart files are run in the terminal

 Following, the hello world code snippet in the file "hello_world.dart":

```javascript
main() {
    print("Hello World!");
}
```

To run this file in the terminal, use the following command:

```
dart hello_world.dart
```

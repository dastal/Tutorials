# Numbers #
There are two different kinds of numbers:

- Integers `int`
- Doubles/ Floating Point Numbers `double`

We can apply any type of math:

- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplicaiton `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulo `%`

The order of execution of the mathematical operators is like ususal. 

If we have variables that we want to increase or decrease in some way, we can use the following synthax:

```javascript
quantity += 50;
```

Or if we just want to increase (works also for decreasing) it by 1, we can use:

```javascript
quantity++;
```


If we have to perform higher mathematical operations, ther is the library called `dart:math`. In this library we can find operations like:

- `min()`/ `max()`
- `sqrt()`
- etc.

# Functions #

A function is a collection of code that can be reused mutliple times. 

Declaring the function has to be outside of the `main` function. Generally after the square brackets there is no need for Semicolons.

Example:
```javascript
void drawTriangle() {
  print("   /|");
  print("  / |");
  print(" /  |");
  print("/___|");
}
```

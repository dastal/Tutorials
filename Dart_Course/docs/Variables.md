# Variables #
To use a variable inside of a string, we can use the following procedure:

```javascript
String character_name = "Stanley";
print("There once was a man named ${character_name}.");
```

Here, a reassignment is possible. This means that we can use a variable for a first part, then change it and reuse it with the other variable.

# Introduction #

## Main Function ##
The `main` function is the function that serves as the starting point for program execution. It looks as follows:

```javascript
main {

}
```

## Hello World ##
The print statement is as follows:

```javascript
print("");
```

Make sure that you end every line with a semi colon!

## Program Execution Flow ##
Basically, the program is executed from the top to the bottom, which means that in the example case below, the first print statement is executed first, then the second, third and so on.

```javascript
print("   /|");  
print("  / |");  
print(" /  |");  
print("/___|");
```

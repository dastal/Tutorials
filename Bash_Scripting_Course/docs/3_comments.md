# Comments #

A single line comment is as follows:

```
# this is a comment
```

A multi line comment is as follows:

```
: '
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment
this is a multiline comment'
```

If you want to have a comment on the command line while executing the file, the following can be used:

```
cat << creative
hello this is a creative text
adding another line
creative
```

whereas the word "creative" can also be something else. The important thing here is that the statement starts and ends with the same key word.

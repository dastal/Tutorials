# MongoDB Course #
Course to get familiar with MongoDB. I used this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyTWPr_WwdI) to complete the course.

## Setup ##
- IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Open a new folder
- Open a new terminal
- Type `npm init -y`
- Type `npm install body-parser`
- Type `npm install express`
- Type `npm install mongodb`
- Type `npm install path`

In the "package.json" file, change under `main: index.js` to `main: app.js` (this is just a personal preference of the lecturer, but to not have confusions, I did the same thing)

## Course Content ##
Following a table with the course content:

| Lecture | Content |
| :------ | :------ |
| [Setting up Project](https://github.com/dastal/Tutorials/blob/main/Mongo_DB_Course/docs/Setup_Project.md) | Detailed setup of the project, especially connecting the database with the application |

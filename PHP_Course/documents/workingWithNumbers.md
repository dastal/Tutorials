# Working with Numbers #


## Basic Maths ##
There are two different types of numbers in PHP:

- Integers
- Decimal Numbers

The mathematical operations are as usual:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulo (%)

The order of Operations is mathematical, i.e. for example multiplications before subtractions etc.

Numbers can be stored in normal variables, like for example:

```
$num = 10;
```

The increment and the decrement of a number are as follows:

```
$num++;
$num--;
```

The following operations are the same (the same counts for the subtraction):

```
$num = $num + 25;
$num += 25;
```

## Advanced Maths ##
For advanced maths there are math functions. Following are some of them, with a description if needed:

- `abs(number)`
- `pow(basis, exponent)`
- `sqrt(number)`
- `max(number1, number2)`
- `min(number1, number2)`
- `round(decimalNumber)`, rounds mathematically
- `ceil(decimalNumber)`, rounds always up
- `floow(decimalNumber)`, rounds always down

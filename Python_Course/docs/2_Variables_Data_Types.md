# Variables and Data Types #
If we have a print statement in a string and we want to change a variable, we have to define the variable 
and insert it into the print statement, as follows:

```
variable = "something"

print("Something to print with the variable" + variable + "inside this print statement.")
```

Now we can just change the variable and the print statement will be automatically updated.

Until now we only discussed the data type string. However there are also numbers and booleans:

```
number = 50
decimal_number = 50.123
boolean = true
```

# Getting Input from Users #

The template for getting input from a user is as follows:

```
input_variable = input("<Prompt>")
```

What python does here is that it prints the prompt inside of the brackets of `input` to the console. 
Following the user can input what is asked from him, and the input is then stored inside of that input 
variable.

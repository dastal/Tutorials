# Neural Networks #

Goal: Finding patterns.

Have a look onto the figure below. First of all, we have input nodes (xi) and one output node (y1). The Input nodes have different wheigts (importances, wi) how they are given into the model, furthermore there is a bias (side noise, bi) for every input node.
The function for y1 is shown in the upper formula, the way how the model is trained is in the lower formula.

We also have to add hidden layers (see in the figure below).

Neural Networks can be used for classification, e.g. image recognition, text classification or also for regression, e.g. chatbots, AI and robotics.

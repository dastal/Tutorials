# CNN #
CNN is the short form of Convolutional Neural Network. Have a look at the following Figure:

The blue layer is the convolutional layer. The difference between the convolutional layer and normal dense layers is that the convolutional layer adds a filter.
The filter allows the layer to detect patterns, and this is why CNN is mostly used for image recognition.

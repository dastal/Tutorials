# SKlearn Tutorial
 Tutorial I completed to get used to scikit learn. I used this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqNCD_5r0IU). For further information on scikit-learn, use this [Link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
 
 ## Setup
- [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html): cmd - `pip install -U scikit-learn`
- IDE: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/download/#section=windows) - Community Version
- For graphs: Jupyter Notebook on [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/)

### For every new project in PyCharm
#### Setup (in case it does not run correctly)
Update PyCharm to the newest version and create an entirely new project with that version. Then open the PyCharm terminal and import the following libraries:

#### Libraries
Do the installation of the following libraries one after another in the terminal of PyCharm:
- Pandas: `pip install pandas`
- Numpy: `pip install numpy`
- Scipy: `pip install scipy`
- Scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
- Sklearn: `pip install sklearn`

After the installation restart PyCharm.

## Content
Following I listed up all the documents I created during the tutorial. Each section of the course has its own document.

| Subject | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| [Creating a Graph](Docs/Graph.md) | In advance to the course a short digression to plotting data. |
| [Features and Labels](Docs/FeaturesLabels.md) | Understanding the terms feature and label in machine learning. |
| [Classification](Docs/Classification.md) | Understanding how classification works. |
| [Train Test Split](Docs/TrainTestSplit.md) | Getting to know the three terms train test and split. Contains also a first aid kit for the PyCharm project in case that it does not run correctly. |
| [KNN](Docs/KNN.md) | Getting to know the concept of K nearest neighbours, including an example. |
| [SVM](Docs/SVM.md) | Getting to know the concept of Support Vector Machine, including an example. |
| [Linear Regression](Docs/Linear_regression.md) | Ordinary Linear Regression Example. |
| [Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression](Docs/lin_vs_log.md) | Discussing the difference between linear regression and logic regression and getting to know the concept of K-Means |
| [Neural Networks](Docs/Neural_Networks.md) |  |

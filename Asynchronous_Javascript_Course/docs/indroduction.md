# Introduction #
Asynchronous Javascript is used to make bigger projects more effictient. I allows us to break down big projects into smaller tasks. 
Then, we can use one of the following methods:

- Callback
- Promise
- Async/ Await

Example:
We want to make fruit ice cream. Therefore we break up the whole task of making ice cream into smaller tasks.
To understand the process even better we add the time that it takes to finish the tasks:

1. The customer makes the order (2)
2. We cut the fruit (2)
3. We add water and ice (1)
4. we start the machine (1)
5. we select the container (2)
6. we select the topics (3)
7. we serve the ice cream (2)

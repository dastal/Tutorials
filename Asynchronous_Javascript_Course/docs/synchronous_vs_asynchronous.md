# Synchronous vs. Asynchronous #

## Synchronous ##
A good example is an old website, where each picture is loaded afer another. When you had additionally slow internet or a bad connection, 
then you were able to observe loading each picture one by one. To illustrate this, have a look at the following image:

[synchronous](images/synchronous.png)

If any process stops, then the whole process stops too.

## Asynchronous ##
In an asychronous website, the pictures load together. To illustrate this, have a look ath the following image.

[asynchronous](images/asynchronous.png)

If any process stops, the whole system is not affected from that stop.
